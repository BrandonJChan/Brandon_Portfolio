</p>

Softwares used: Python, Jupyter Notebooks
- Developed a Spotify song reccomendation model using my personal Spotify listening history and integrating it with Spotify's audio features API
- The data used was every single song I listening to in a four-month period, the number of times I played each song, and each song's audio features (danceability, energy, loudness, etc.)
  - Predicted the number of plays for each song 
- In search of the highest performing model, optimized K-Nearest Neighbors, Ridge, Random Forest, and various Ensemble Regressors for minimizing Mean Squared Error
- Used model to reccomend songs from my "Release Radar" playlist, a Spotify-generated playlist containing recently-released songs
- Based on my enjoyment of the reccomended songs, I would say that I succeeded!

</p>

Softwares used: R

- Developed a classification model that categorizes news headlines as fake or real
- The data used was 44,689 news headlines from 2015 to 2018
- Derived training and testing datasets by calculating TF-IDF values for the top 1000 most frequent words among all headlines
- Evaluated the performance of nine different models ranging in complexity from Logistic Regression and Classification Trees all the way to Random Forest and Neural Networks.
- The best performing model was the Support Vector Machine, with a test accuracy of 87.75% and an area under the ROC curve of 95%.

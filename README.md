## [Spotify Reccomendation Model](https://github.com/BrandonJChan/Spotify_Reccomendation_Model)
![](spotify%20logo.png)
Softwares used: Python, Jupyter Notebooks
- Developed a Spotify song reccomendation model using my personal Spotify listening history and integrating it with Spotify's audio features API
- The data used was every single song I listening to in a four-month period, the number of times I played each song, and each song's audio features (danceability, energy, loudness, etc.)
  - Predicted the number of plays for each song 
- In search of the highest performing model, optimized K-Nearest Neighbors, Ridge, Random Forest, and various Ensemble Regressors for minimizing Mean Squared Error
- Used model to reccomend songs from my "Release Radar" playlist, a Spotify-generated playlist containing recently-released songs
